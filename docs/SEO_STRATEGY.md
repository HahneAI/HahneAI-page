### GEO Content Strategies

1. **Clear, Factual Statements**
   ```
   Bad: "We're the best AI company"
   Good: "HahneAI builds custom AI systems for businesses,
          specializing in workflow automation and integration"
   ```

   Outcome: [Measurable result]
   ```

   - Answer questions directly and completely
   - Use natural language
   - Include in Schema.org FAQPage markup

4. **Structured Data**
   - Helps AI understand entity relationships
   - Improves citation likelihood

5. **Lists and Tables**
   - AI models parse structured content better
   - Use for comparisons, features, processes

## Competitor Gap Analysis

### Underserved Topics (Opportunities)

1. **Industry-Specific AI** - Most competitors are generic
2. **Small Business AI** - Enterprise focus dominates
3. **Human Oversight AI** - Safety/control messaging rare

5. **Non-Technical Implementation** - Most assume technical buyers

### HahneAI Differentiators

| Competitor Approach | HahneAI Approach |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Technology-first | Problem-first |
| SaaS platforms | Custom systems |
| Feature lists | Business outcomes |
| Vendor relationship | Partnership model |

### Content Opportunities

1. Industry-specific AI use case pages
2. AI implementation case studies
3. ROI calculator or assessment tool
4. "AI for [Industry]" landing pages
5. "Common AI implementation mistakes" content
